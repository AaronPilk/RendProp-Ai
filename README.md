# Rendprop

Rendprop brings phone capture, video editing, AI creative tools and property
marketing into one workspace. Capture photos and walkthrough footage on iPhone,
continue a property edit in Studio, and prepare reels and hosted property pages.
Real estate is the primary workflow; the app also supports other space types.

## Verified production baseline — 24 September 2026

| Area | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| Studio web | Live: Create is the main workspace, with chat editing, Simple/Pro controls, preview and browser MP4/WebM export. |
| Prompt enhancement | Live guided suggestions, reviewed before use. Optional model-powered planning/enhancement endpoints are deployed but disabled. |
| Prompt library | Ten original recipes, adaptation, saved personal collections and result notes. Copying a prompt does not generate media. |
| Property workflow | Account-scoped media, one private edit per user/property, saved conversation, capture plans, versions and team review. Local videos remain browser-local. |
| AI Presenter | Preparation, approvals and execution controls deployed; Higgsfield generation remains disabled. |
| iOS | Native capture, media, editing and connected workflows are implemented. A web release does not ship an iOS binary; phone capture testing and App Store Connect remain with the owner. |
| 3D walkthrough | Capture/upload/viewer and worker controls exist. Reconstruction quality has not passed acceptance; see the [spatial status](services/spatial-worker/README.md). |

The Studio release passed all 12 CI jobs. Live verification matched 27 web files
and 75 deployed function source files, restored an existing signed-in workspace,
and exercised prompt review without submitting an edit. This is not a fresh
Apple sign-in, real-phone capture/sync or live AI-quality certification. Exact
versions, migration history, remaining gates and evidence are in the release note.

## Current source beyond that baseline

Studio now includes named private video projects with uploaded originals and
cross-browser restoration, imported music with mixing/fades/ducking, reviewed
beat-cut proposals, source-timed speech captions and speaking-passage suggestions.
An explicit local editing-copy tool prepares large recordings for the browser.
General projects need no property; property reels retain their agency review and
delivery workflow. See [projects and finishing](docs/studio/projects-and-finishing.md).

These additions await a new production receipt. Text-route seeds and bounded
speech analysis are implemented; their live activation is separate from source
availability. [Editing intelligence activation](docs/studio/editing-intelligence-activation.md)
records gates, pricing estimates and acceptance checks. Presenter generation stays
disabled, and this work does not establish phone or spatial-quality acceptance.

## Start developing

For Studio, use Node.js **22.12 or newer**:

```sh
cd apps/studio
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Local creation works without a backend. A connected workspace requires the
public Supabase configuration described in the [Studio README](apps/studio/README.md).
Never put service-role or provider credentials in frontend environment variables.

```sh
# From apps/studio: unit tests, typecheck, build and distribution checks
npm run verify
```

Browser media tests also exercise real encoded synthetic videos. See the
[CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) and each component's test instructions for
the required browser, Deno, Python, PostgreSQL and Xcode environments. Simulator
tests cannot validate physical camera, ARKit/LiDAR capture or thermal behavior.

The [original master build prompt](docs/MASTER-BUILD-PROMPT.md) records product
intent and planned work. Current source, tests and dated deployment receipts
establish what is implemented and live; roadmap language is not a shipping claim.
Historical audit and release folders retain their original measurements.

Use isolated branches when collaborating. Preserve migration history and existing
function authentication settings; apply schema before dependent handlers and web
assets. The updated [backend deployment helper](apps/studio/scripts/deploy-backend.mjs)
requires explicit function selection, stages offline by default and preserves
the declared JWT policy. With `--run`, it checks live policy and verifies deployed
source hashes. No disabled provider or spatial gate
should be activated merely to complete a UI demonstration.
